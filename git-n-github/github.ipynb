Watchers will get notifications whenever something happens on the repository (e.g., issue, pull request, commits, etc.).  Starring a repo essentially \"bookmarks\" the repo so you can easily find it on your GitHub home page, but stars are also a good metric of popularity of a repo.

    "5. The next line contains buttons that give the ability to quickly switch or create a branch, create a new \"Pull Request\", create a new file, upload new files, find a file, or get a link to the repo so you can clone it (or download it as a tarball).\n",

You can view any of the files, or enter any directory, simply by clicking on it.  Notice that our new repository contains only 3 files, a `README.md` markdown file, a `.gitignore` (which tells Git to not track certain files that match defined patterns), and a `LICENSE` file that matches the Apache-2.0 format.\n",

And, as a good practice, all new changes to a repository should be _vetted_ (i.e., reviewed) by a trusted contributor.  You can do this with branches and merges using GitHub's \"Pull Request\" capability, but even then a full-fledged contributor can just merge their changes without review.  (Though you can set up your repository settings to require at least 1 reviewer before code is merged.  We won't go into that detail here.)\n",
